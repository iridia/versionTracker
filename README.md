# Iridia Version Tracker

Minimalist version tracker application for our iOS applications which eventually handles over-the-air beta installs, collects crash reports, symbolication, version tracking and Redmine integration.

This is an actively developed for-learning project not ready yet for commercial use.  The project is licensed under the new BSD license but weâ€™ll appreciate link-backs if appropriate.
